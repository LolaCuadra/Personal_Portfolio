# Overview

This code is a simple Hello world code just to start my personal portfolio as a Software Engineer.

This code prints a single line of code that prints "Hello World". This is a very basic code, and is usually the first sentence all programmers first learn when they are introduce to coding.  

on my links below, I've attached the frist person who wrote said sentence story behind it.

# Development Environment
For this project I used python, since is the very first language I learned when I first started to code. I will say this is the language I'm more proeficient at. As well as the "Hello world" always bring sweet memories of my very first day learning to code.
